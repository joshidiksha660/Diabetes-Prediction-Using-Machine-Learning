# Diabetes Prediction System

A machine learning project that predicts whether a person is diabetic using key health indicators such as BMI, HbA1c level, blood glucose, age, and lifestyle factors.

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project compares **Decision Tree** and **Random Forest** classifiers to identify the most reliable model for diabetes prediction. The dataset is preprocessed with encoding, scaling, and feature selection to ensure accurate predictions.

## 📊 Key Features
- Performed data cleaning, label encoding, and feature scaling  
- Trained **Decision Tree** and **Random Forest** models  
- Achieved **95% accuracy** using Random Forest  
- Visualized model performance using **Plotly**  
- Compared classification reports, confusion matrices, & feature importance  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Plotly  
- Jupyter Notebook / Python Script  

## 📦 Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
